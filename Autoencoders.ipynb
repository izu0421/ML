How can we find the importance within it?\n","\n","When we see things, we don't consciously percieve the wavelength of light hitting each of our individual cells. This is the very high dimensional, raw input data that your eyes recieve, but this information is too complex for us to use for planning and decision making etc. Instead, what we do is perform abstraction from it - we build up more meaningful, general and vague descriptions of the environment.\n","We percieve and would describe the scene using a few high level *features* such as: ' I see a face', 'It is smiling', 'It is nearby' rather than the millions of raw wavelengths. We somehow manage to map the high dimensional, low level wavelength data into much lower dimensional, high level concepts. The variables that we choose to represent the data in this lower dimensional space are called **latent variables**. \n","\n","## What is an autoencoder?\n","\n","An autoencoder is a unsupervised machine learning model that can learn a latent representation of input data, that is a lower dimensional higher level \n","An autoencoder learns to do so by passing the input through a neural network which attempts to output the same thing (or slightly different) as it is given as an input, whilst passing the data through a low dimensional bottleneck in between. We can determine a loss by taking the BCE loss between the input and its reconstruction at the output. This means that training requires no labels!\n","\n","<img src=\"autoencoder.png\">\n","\n","A lower dimensional representation is much more easily interpretable than the higher dimensional input, as there is just less information to comprehend.\n","Having a trained autoencoder means that we have found a way to represent our data in a lower dimension with minimal loss.\n","Our inputs can be reconstructed \n","\n","We will train out autoencoder to come up with valuable ways of representing the data in interpretable, low-dimensional space, by attempting to minimise the binary cross entropy loss between the input image and its reconstruction.\n","\n","Note that \n","\n","### Use cases of autencoders\n","#### Denoising\n","Autoencoders can be used to remove noise from images by training them to reconstruct images from those which have had noise added to them\n","\n","<img src='denoising autoencoder.png'>\n","\n","Autoencoders can also be used\n","\n","\n","#### Learning latent representations\n","\n","As we have seen, autoencoders can find a way to project input data down into a lower dimension whilst keeping it useful. They can extract higher level concepts from low dimensional data - essentially abstracting from the data.\n","\n","**Autoencoders allow us to learn the higher level features within the raw data without using labels!**\n","\n","### Problems with autoencoders\n","\n","- the reconstruction of the input will be lossy, as information must be thrown away to compress the input down to a lower dimension. Many other techniques, like JPEG, far outperform autoencoders in terms of image comp\n","- the weights learned by the model are specific to the data it has been trained on. There is nothing preventing  a lot of latent space never being sampled for training. As such, the latent space may be sparse and can not be sampled from to produce an outpput. This prevents autoencoders being used as generative models.\n","- the diverging part of the model can not robustly be used to generate data, because the latent space may be filled with gaps where that model has not learnt to reconstruct any data from. \n","- the latent representations for similar inputs/inputs may not be nearby in the latent space.\n","\n","## Variational Autoencoders\n","\n","One problem with autoencoders is that \n","\n","Variational autencoders are an upgrade on autoencoders. The VAE model differs from that of a standard autoencoder in two ways.\n","\n","1. The latent representation of a given input is stochastic. The encoder network constists of two networks that output an 'ideal mean' and an 'ideal standard deviation' (in practice, the log(variance))for each training example. It's corresponding latent representation is then produced by sampling from a Gaussian characterised by these parameters. We are not learning *these* parameters, but the weights in the encoder network leading to them, which must make them useful for reconstructing the input later.\n","\n","2. The loss function includes a KL-divergence term. KL-divergence is used to make distributions more similar; where functions have greatly different outputs, the KL-divergence will be large, and where they are the same, the KL-divergence will be zero. In our case we take the KL-divergence between our generated probability This forces the calculated means to be c\n","\n","<img src='KL.png'>\n","\n","They ensure that the latent space is filled, and that similar outputs occupy nearby regions in the latent space. They do this by minimising the difference between how the latent variables are distributed compared wth some prior (initially expected) distribution, $p(z)$. We usually take our prior distribution over $z$ to be a unit Gaussian - a reasonable assumption, as lots of things in real life are distributed normally.\n","So each latent variable now is forced to be distributed normally around zero, with unit variance. This \n","\n","**\n","\n","## Beta Variational Autencoders\n","\n","So for VAEs, we have two terms in the loss function: the reconstruction loss which makes sure that we get back a similar image to our input. And the KL-divergence, which ensures that the latent space which a realistic output can be generated from is continuous, and that similar examples are nearby in the latent space. \n","Beta-VAEs put another hyperparamete (Beta) "]},{"metadata":{"id":"0FkKgaXse3H3","colab_type":"code","colab":{"autoexec":{"startup":false,"wait_interval":0}}},"cell_type":"code","source":[""],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[]}]}
