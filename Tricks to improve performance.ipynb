Many techniques are praised as amazing if they can consistently offer even 1% of extra accuracy. That extra accracy could be what is separating them from human-level or above performance so make sure you add these once you have a basic model working."]},{"metadata":{"id":"28m7BNNp1wzN","colab_type":"text"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Vanishing and Exploding gradients\n","Two key problems that arise when training neural networks are vanishing and exploding gradients. These problems are when we have deep networks and are due to the fact that the first layers' gradients are calculated using the chain rule which requires us to multiply with the gradients of the final layer neurons. Consider the case when we are using a sigmoid activation function with the network shown below. As you can see each time we calculate the gradients for nodes closer to the input, we multiply by a $\\sigma'(z_i)$ term. Given that the max value that this derivative of the sigmoid can take is 0.25 as shown in the graph below, our gradients will reduce by atleast a factor of 4 each time we add a layer. The gradient vanishes which makes learning very slow in the earlier layers. This is especially a problem if the neuron (z-value) is satuarated meaning it takes on a very high or very low value. This is because the derivative for very high and low sigmoid inputs is practically 0. <br> \n","exploding gradient = infinity * infinity from the weights --> gradients going to infinity <br> \n","vanishing = due to derivative of the gradients --> gradients go to 0 <br> \n","z-score: \n","- The standard score (more commonly referred to as a z-score) is a very useful statistic because it (a) allows us to calculate the probability of a score occurring within our normal distribution and (b) enables us to compare two scores that are from different normal distributions.\n","\n","\n","![](nngrad.png)\n","\n","$J = \\frac{1}{2}(h-y)^2$\n","\n","$h = \\sigma(z_3)$&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$z_3 = w_3a_2$\n","\n","$a_2 = \\sigma(z_2)$&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$z_2 = w_2a_1$\n","\n","$a_1 = \\sigma(z_1)$&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$z_1 = w_1x$\n","\n","$\\frac{\\partial J}{\\partial w_3} = (h-y)\\ \\sigma'(z_3)\\ a_2$\n","\n","$\\frac{\\partial J}{\\partial w_2} = (h-y)\\ \\sigma'(z_3)\\ w_3\\ \\sigma'(z_2)\\ a_1$\n","\n","$\\frac{\\partial J}{\\partial w_1} = (h-y)\\ \\sigma'(z_3)\\ w_3\\ \\sigma'(z_2)\\ w_2\\ \\sigma'(z_1)\\ x$\n","\n","![](sigderiv.png)\n","\n","In certain cases, the w terms can get very high and after being multiplied all the way through the network can lead to an extremely high gradient causing us to jump about all over the cost surface, never converging.
