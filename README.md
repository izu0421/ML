# ML

These are my Jupyter Notes on Machine Learning taken after various ML courses. They are primarily designed for teaching purposes using Google Collab. 
They are designed for a tutorial on ML for Life Scientists. 

Special thanks to Harry and Haron from the Imperial College Machine Learning society, whose code I used to compile this tutorial.
